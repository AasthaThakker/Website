# How Everyone Started Coding in Plain English
![Placeholder for Cover Image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQHZ2hITB5ZSNA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B4DZgXrB8oGgAI-/0/1752743814367?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=m5u20c_hAj_wtYP9f0VrWsXwRUK8HKhDVGEN7tkhjVg)

Have you ever been so into coding that you’re just typing away while your favorite music plays in the background, and you don’t even notice you’re vibing along? That’s the feeling we’ve all chased, but what if I told you that “vibe coding” isn’t just about the music anymore?

The term that started as our inside joke about coding with good tunes has evolved into something that’s about to revolutionize how we build software entirely. This isn’t the typical “lo-fi beats to code to” story.

In February 2025, New York Times journalist Kevin Roose, who is not a professional coder, experimented with vibe coding to create several small-scale applications. He described these as “software for one”, referring to personalized AI-generated tools designed to address specific individual needs.

## What We Thought We Knew vs. What’s Actually Happening

*What we thought:*  
Vibe coding = good music + caffeine + that magical flow state where bugs fix themselves.  

*The traditional way:*  
Master every syntax rule → Write detailed logic → Debug line by line → Repeat  

*What’s actually happening:*  
Vibe coding has become the umbrella term for high-level, natural-language-driven software development that can orchestrate entire projects from a single conversational prompt.  

*The vibe coding way:*  
Describe your vision → AI generates code → You evaluate and refine → Iterate until perfect  

We’re entering an era where you can describe your vision in plain English and watch as multi-agent systems generate everything from directory structures to API layers, user interfaces, test suites, and even CI/CD configurations.

## What’s This “Vibe” All About?

*Vision-Informed:*  
Rather than starting with technical constraints, you begin with a clear vision of what you want. Your development process is constantly informed by this overarching goal, ensuring every decision aligns with your intended outcome.

*Interactive:*  
Vibe coding isn’t a one-shot prompt; it’s a dynamic, back-and-forth creative process. You don’t just describe what you want and walk away. You converse with the AI, shaping the outcome through feedback, refinement, and iteration.

*Behavioral:*  
You’re not just building features, you’re crafting behaviors. How should your application respond to user actions? What personality should it have? How should it make users feel? This behavioral focus transforms code from mere functionality into meaningful interaction.

*Engineering:*  
Despite the high-level approach, this remains disciplined engineering. You’re applying systematic thinking, architectural principles, and quality standards, just at a more strategic level where AI handles the implementation details.

> By the way, this V.I.B.E. meaning isn’t official or from any rulebook. I made it up to explain things in a better way. Just thought it would make the whole idea easier to get.

## Why Has It Become a Trend?

- *From syntax master to intent communicator:*  
  Instead of memorizing every programming language quirk, you focus on architectural vision and creative problem-solving. The AI handles the syntactic details while you handle the strategic thinking. Rather than remembering the exact syntax for React hooks, you communicate intent:  
  “Create a React component that fetches user data on mount, shows a loading state, handles errors gracefully, and updates the UI when data changes.”

- *Interactive and improvisational:*  
  It’s not a one-way street. You give guidance, the AI responds, you evaluate the results, provide feedback, and iterate. This creates a dynamic, almost conversational approach to building software that feels more like collaboration than traditional programming.

- *Intuitive and human-centered:*  
  The process aligns with how humans naturally think and communicate, rather than forcing us to translate our ideas into rigid formal logic.

## The Five Essential Skills Every Vibe Coder Must Master
![Placeholder](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFm9dEkEGu83Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/B4DZgXrFETHYAU-/0/1752743826659?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=xSDudaRcbvRtz0JC00E8rH-dHaUAs5Jz79kFk5ATI5Y)

Here’s the thing about vibe coding: it’s not just about having good communication skills with AI. The “vibe” represents something much deeper — a holistic understanding of your developer intent that encompasses functionality, usability, and design all at once.

### 1. Strategic Problem Formulation (The “Thinking” Skill)

This is where the magic begins — and it’s way more sophisticated than just “tell the AI what you want.”

#### The Four Layers of Strategic Thinking:
1. *Logical Thinking (The Core “What”):* Strip away all the noise and identify the fundamental problem you’re solving. What’s the single most important thing your software needs to accomplish?  
2. *Analytical Thinking (User Interaction Design):* How will real humans interact with this? What are the high-level components they’ll encounter? Map out the user journey before diving into features.  
3. *Computational Thinking (AI-Friendly Structure):* Break down your vision into modules, rules, and data flows that an AI can understand and work with effectively. This is about speaking the AI’s language while maintaining your human perspective.  
4. *Procedural Thinking (Execution Strategy):* Consider the optimal way to build this, industry best practices, and detailed features that will make or break the user experience.  

*The outcome?*  
A comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) that serves as your AI’s roadmap, detailed enough to guide development but flexible enough to allow for creative solutions.

---

### 2. Architectural Awareness (The “Framework” Skill)

You don’t need to memorize every React hook or Django command, but you need to understand the landscape of modern development.

*Why this matters:*  
When you can guide your AI toward proven frameworks like React, Node.js, or Django, you’re not just getting code — you’re getting maintainable, scalable, industry-standard solutions.

*The strategic advantage:*  
You can also flip this relationship and ask your AI to recommend the best frameworks for your specific project requirements. It becomes a collaborative exploration of what’s possible.

---

### 3. Version Control Mastery (The “Checkpoints” Skill)

AI-generated code can be brilliant — or it can completely break your project. Version control isn’t just recommended; it’s critical.

#### Your safety net strategy:
- Frequent commits create “save points” you can return to  
- Branching lets you experiment with AI-generated features without risking your main codebase  
- You can try bold, experimental approaches, knowing you can always revert  

*The reality:*  
Vibe coding moves fast. Without solid version control, you’re essentially coding without a safety net.

---

### 4. Collaborative Debugging (The “Debugging” Skill)

Forget lonely debugging sessions. In vibe coding, error resolution becomes a collaborative conversation.

#### The new debugging process:
1. Identify the issue (runtime error, logical flaw, UI problem)  
2. Provide rich context to your AI — error messages, code snippets, expected vs. actual behavior, even screenshots  
3. Guide the diagnostic process while the AI suggests solutions  
4. Validate and iterate on the AI’s recommendations  

*Key insight:*  
Your role shifts from finding solutions to effectively communicating problems and evaluating AI-generated fixes.

---

### 5. Context Mastery (The “Information” Skill)

This is the skill that separates good vibe coders from great ones. The quality of your output is directly proportional to the quality of context you provide. Rich context eliminates ambiguity and helps your AI generate exactly what you have thought.

#### Essential context elements:
- Comprehensive PRDs and clear prompts  
- Visual mockups and examples of desired output  
- Existing codebase snippets for consistency  
- API documentation for integrations  
- Explicit preferences for libraries, coding styles, and security constraints

So, this was all about the basics of vibe coding. In the next blog, we will cover more about how to prompt, what people are actually building, and the challenges faced.
